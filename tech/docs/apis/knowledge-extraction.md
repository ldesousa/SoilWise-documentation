# Knowledge extraction API

An API providing machine-based access to the SWR knowledge graph. This API is most likely to conform to an existing meta-data standard, such as the OGC API Records. However, its responses are RDF documents, for instance encoded with JSON-LD syntax. Other components of the SWR performing knowledge extraction and/or augmentation may also use this API to interact with the knowledge graph.
