# Metadata publication APIs

An API could be developed to publish metadata. 

Requires a user to be logged in and have publication permission.

A review step may have to be required before allowing the record on the catalogue?

A suggestion for development could be to let the API prepare a Pull request to Git, for the record to be merged into the metadata collection.

Interaction with:

- Login and authorisation module
- Git repository
