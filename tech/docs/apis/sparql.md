# SPARQL API

This is the primary access point to the knowledge graph, both for humans, as well as for machines. Many applications and end users will instead interact with specialised assets that use the SPARQL end-point, such as the Chatbot or the API. However, the SPARQL end-point is the main source for the development of further knowledge applications and provides bespoke search to humans.

Consider that this component relates to the [knowledge extraction](./knowledge-extraction.md) component, which describes alternative mechanisms to access selected parts of the knowledge graph.

## SPARQL ENDPOINT

- development aid
- technical query interface behind APIs

## Technology

A number of proven open source triple store implementation exist. In the next iteration we will use the virtuoso software as a starting point.

## Metadata

- connections with: APIs
- technologies used: It is provided by the same technology hosting the meta-data catalogue.
- responsible person: should be the same of the Catalogue.
- participating: Lu√≠s de Sousa, Anne Fensel, Paul van Genuchten, Hugo de Groot
