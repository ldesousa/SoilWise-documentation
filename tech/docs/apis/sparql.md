# SPARQL API

This is the primary access point to the knowledge graph, both for humans, as well as for machines. Many applications and end users will instead interact with specialised assets that use the SPARQL end-point, such as the Chatbot or the API. However, the SPARQL end-point is the main source for the development of further knowledge applications and provides bespoke search to humans.
