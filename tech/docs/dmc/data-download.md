# Data download & export

Considerations

- The FAIR principle endorses the use of persistent identification for the data download, which would result in a full download of the data/knowledge resource
- An api to data enables partial/filtered results from a dataset, data download api's are available trough [mapserver](./map-server.md) via WFS, WCS and OGCAPI-Features
- Novel formats such as GeoParquet, COG, GeoZarr allow range (subset) requests to a single endpoint, and could combine FAIR identification and subset-requests
