## Enhancing metadata items

AI/ML and other analytics will be used to enrich metadata

The following applications can be thought of
- using a soil (health) ontology to label data and knowledge, based on
- interlinking different sources: data - data, knowledge - knowledge and data - knowledge, see automatic metadata interlinking
- finding associated data & knowledge, e.g. citations, usage of data, methodologies

## Alignment with existing data

RLO: not sure what this component is intended to do...
DSN: I put it in the architecture based on the UC01-US01 need for benchmarking... probably we should remove it

## Automatic metadata interlinking

To be able to provide interlinked data and knowledge assets (e.g. a dataset, the project in which it was generated and the operating procedure used) links between metadata must be identified and registered as part of the [SWR knowledge graph](publication.md#knowledge-graph)

- **Explicit links** can be directly derived from the data and/or metadata. E.g. projects in CORDIS are explicitly linked to documents and datasets. 
For those linkages, the harvesting process needs to be extended, calling this component to store the relation in the knowledge graph. It should accomodate "vice versa linkage" (if resource A links to B, a vice versa link can be added to B)
- **Implicit links** can not be directly derived from the (meta)data. They may be derived by spatial or temporal extent, keyword usage, shared author/publisher. In this case, AI/ML can support the discovery of potential links, including somekind of probability indicator

## Integration opportunities

The Automatic metadata interlinking component should be connected to: 
- [Automated igestion of metadata on knowledge sources](ingestion.md#automated-ingestion-of-metadata-on-knowledge-sources) (initiate)
- [Metadata store](storage.md#metadata) (read)
- [Knowledge graph](publication.md#knowledge-graph) (read/write)
- Assess livelyhood of a link (see [Link persistence validator](./data_processing.md#link-persistence-validator))

## Metadata ranking

- Research item: Rank relevance of a resource by evaluating usage logs

## High-value data & knowledge identification

Is this somehow related to metadata ranking?
DSN: It was meant as a component which taggs metadata records as "high-value" based on given criteria (see UC03-US-22, UC02-US13 lead me to thinking that high-value tag could apply to knowledge as well)


## Sophisticated Large Language Model

** ToDo **
<!-- 
This model will be trained on the knowledge graph. It aims to provide an easy to use and personified interaction mechanism with the knowledge harnessed at the SWR. It is the main comp supporting the Chatbot component of the user interface.
-->

## AI, ML

- **To be decided on** - Questionable if this should be a separate component, maybe integrated part of other components?

## Extraction of KPIs from data

- **To be decided on** - in the session on land manager UCs we concluded that KPIs will either come from (Soil Mission) projects as in input to SWR, or would be derived by an intermediary and/or end user based on data from SWR

## Generating soil health maps

- **To be decided on** - This seems not in scope for SoilWise, although an effort to create such a map will certainly be a user story, Soilwise to provide input for such an effort (both on data and covariates, as well as how to do it)

<!--
Remaining notes:
- Identify project scope of a resource from CORDIS
- Identify type of a remote resources, if linked from a metadata (download, api, record, document)
-->

_T1.4 will produce detailed technical specifications, including information on components to be (re)used, interfaces between them and explaining the data flows and processing schemes, considering AgriDataSpace project conceptual reference architecture, **AI/ML architecture patterns and the Ethics by Design in AI.**_
