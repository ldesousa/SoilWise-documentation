# Data2Knowledge processing (Rob)

- understands what is in any soil repository & how to use it
- gives output to interlinker
- AI used for labelling information, interlinking metadata (linked with the box below),
documents
- analysis of CORDIS (what to link)
- connections with: catalogue (for looking up things), client / presentation (for
enduser interaction), APIs (for machine & developer interaction), schemes &
structures
- technologies used: GloSIS?
- responsible person: Rob Lokers
- participating: Luís de Sousa, Anna Fensel, We Transform, Nick Berkvens, Giovanni

## Enhancing metadata items

Powered by AI

- finding citations and usage of data, methodologies
- provide data labelling
- enable user input??

## Alignment with existing data

## Exitraction of KPIs from data

## Automatic metadata interlinking

- assess livelyhood of a link (see Link persistence validator)
- vice versa linkage
- derive links
- linking to CORDIS

- connections with: retrieve from metadata catalog, write to SPARQL, notify user?

## Generating soil health maps

## Sophisticated Large Language Model

This model will be trained on the knowledge graph. It aims to provide an easy to use and personified interaction mechanism with the knowledge harnessed at the SWR. It is the main pillar supporting the Chatbot component of the user interface.

## High-value data & knowledge identification

## AI, ML

_T1.4 will produce detailed technical specifications, including information on components to be (re)used, interfaces between them and explaining the data flows and processing schemes, considering AgriDataSpace project conceptual reference architecture, **AI/ML architecture patterns and the Ethics by Design in AI.**_
